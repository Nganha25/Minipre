We collect them here on Kaggle.com.This web have many datasets for people to analysis with many topics. We want to study player statistics for the Australian Rules Football League (AFL), use different charts to determine who the main players are, predict performance performance and results. Our aim is to filter information about the players to select the best players. Important players performance that no one has noticed before. With scoring competitions in the AFL as popular as any other sport, surely this is just waiting for Data Science to take over.</p>
